dotfiles
========

so here are some dotfiles I make heavy use of. they help me. 

.emacs
------
I use Emacs for editing. This dotfile helps especially when editing Python code,
by running syntax checks as well as checking imports and so on. 

Precondition: flake8 (pip install flake8)

.gitconfig
----------
Some presets for my work with git: aliases etc.

examples:

git st (replacing git status)
git cia -m "add and commit all these files"
